        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Em McPhie. I’m a junior majoring in communication design and minoring in writing.</li>
            <li>I took a computer science class in high school and worked as TA for CSE 131 my freshman year, and enjoyed the experience even though I haven’t done anything coding-related since. I’m very interested in interaction design, particularly as it relates to effective data visualization in the context of digital journalism.</li>
            <li>No experience with HTML/CSS/JS yet!</li>
            <li>I hope to gain a solid foundation in interaction/web design skills, and to be able to communicate and implement my visual ideas in a more technical way.</li>
            <li>Designing for screens needs to be more flexible and fluid than designing for print, but that also gives it more creative potential.</li>
            <li><a href="https://restofworld.org/">Rest of World</a> is an outlet that covers global tech issues. The homepage layout does a good job of having a ton of content without being overwhelming. The typeface choices are also excellent, from the monospace accent font to the angular serif used for body copy.</li>
            <li><a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a> has some of my favorite data visualizations. The essays (like <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/08/screen-direction/">this one</a>) not only feature clever displays of information but also make them interactive, responding to user behavior.</li>
            <li><a href="https://jigsaw.google.com/the-current/white-supremacy/">The Current</a>, a digital publication by Google’s Jigsaw unit, is beautifully designed and does an excellent job of storytelling and conveying data in a variety of ways.</li>
