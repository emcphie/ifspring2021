        <p><br>Life's a losing game when you don't play
            <br>Don't hold your cards too close is what they say
            <br>Now, love is just another leap of faith
            <br>But I jump right in
            <br>
            <br>I took the train, I took the call
            <br>I didn't know just where I'd fall
            <br>Or where it'd take me
            <br>Another step, another stair
            <br>I'll never know if I'll get there
            <br>But just maybe
            <br>
            <br>I want something more than
            <br>More than restless mornings
            <br>Getting by's so boring
            <br>Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
            <br>
            <br>Take another look before it goes
            <br>Days are only footprints in the snow
            <br>How far away can I walk
            <br>Till I'm way too far from home
            <br>I wish I knew, I wish I knew
            <br>
            <br>I want something more than
            <br>More than restless mornings
            <br>Getting by's so boring
            <br>Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
            <br>Take your time, enjoy it
            <br>Every fleeting moment
            <br>Getting by's so boring
            <br>Ah-ooh, ah-ooh
            <br>
            <br>I took the train, I took the car
            <br>I didn't know just where I'd fall
            <br>Or where it'd take me
            <br>Another step, another stair
            <br>I'll never know if I'll get there
            <br>But just maybe

            <br>I want something more than
            <br>More than restless mornings
            <br>Getting by's so boring
